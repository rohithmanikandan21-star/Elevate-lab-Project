Introduction: Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple Python-based application that evaluates the strength of passwords and generates customized wordlists for ethical cybersecurity testing.
This project helps users understand how attackers guess passwords and how strong, unpredictable passwords can resist such attempts.
The scope covers two parts:

a password analyzer that checks password strength, and

a custom wordlist generator that produces likely password variations from user-supplied details such as names, keywords, and years.

Abstract

This project demonstrates password security concepts using two practical Python programs.
The first analyzes password strength using the zxcvbn library and an entropy-based fallback to show how strong or weak a password is.
The second generates personalized wordlists from small sets of user data, applying variations like capitalization, leetspeak substitutions, appended years, and symbol combinations.
Together, they help illustrate both how attackers build dictionary lists and how users can create stronger passwords to defend against such attacks.
The tool can be used from the command line or through a simple Tkinter-based graphical interface.

Tools Used

Python 3: Core language used for implementation.

zxcvbn: Library for analyzing and scoring password strength.

Tkinter: Optional GUI library for interactive password testing.

Argparse: Used for handling command-line input parameters.

OS and Random modules: For file handling, directory creation, and randomized wordlist variations.

Steps Involved

Setup – Create a Python virtual environment and install required libraries using pip.

Analyzer – Implement a password analyzer that provides a strength score and feedback using zxcvbn.

Generator – Collect user inputs (names, keywords, years) and generate combinations, including leetspeak and symbol variants.

Testing – Analyze different passwords and verify the accuracy of generated wordlists.

Output – Save the generated words in a .txt file for review or ethical testing.

GUI – (Optional) Develop a Tkinter interface for easier interaction.

Conclusion

The Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator successfully demonstrates how password complexity can be evaluated and improved.
It shows how simple user data can form predictable passwords, highlighting why random and complex passwords are essential for security.
Limitations include limited scalability for huge datasets and dependence on user input quality.
Future improvements may include integrating real-time policy checks, database storage, and cloud-based testing options.

Conclusion:
This project is designed strictly for learning and authorized cybersecurity research.
It must not be used for unauthorized password cracking, penetration testing, or any illegal purpose.
Always obtain explicit permission before testing any system or network.
